# Complete-an-Arithmetic-Sequence

tfw you spend so much time writing for loops for one question and it turns out there's a mathematical formula for it 💆‍♀️.

I'm gonna ***explode***

***Question You are given a list of integers nums that used to be an arithmetic sequence. Given that a number was removed, and that the number was not the first or the last element, return the removed number.***

I'll be uploading my incomplete solution which works for some test cases but doesn't work for very very special cases. There is also a binary search approach that I wanna look into and understand better. It looks way too complicated though 🔪😌

Another approach that I thought was very interesting was to find the biggest difference between the given numbers and the mid of that number would be the missing value.
